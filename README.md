**Prerequisites:** (the current formal prerequisite is currently listed as EECS 492, Artificial Intelligence, but this is inaccurate)

*   Probability: jointly distributed random variables, multivariate densities and mass functions, expectation, independence, conditional distributions, Bayes rule, the multivariate normal distribution (e.g. EECS 501).
*   Linear algebra: rank, nullity, linear independence, inner products, orthogonality, positive (semi-) definite matrices, eigenvalue decompositions (e.g. EECS 551, MATH 417).
*   Multivariable calculus: partial derivatives, gradients, chain rule
*   Programming skills in Matlab and Python (optional).
*   It is expected that students will have a good working knowledge of these topics. Students with most but not all of this background should be able to catch up during the semester with some additional effort. Certain topics will be briefly reviewed.

**Details:**

Homeworks:  
Homeworks will be assigned bi-weekly. Applications will be developed through programming exercises, including face recognition, spam filtering, handwritten digit recognition, image compression, and image segmentation. MATLAB and Python are the supported languages in the course. You must complete your programming assignments in one of these two languages.

Exam: You may use two cheat sheets (front and back), and no other materials are allowed. Please notify us the first week of class if you have a conflict.

Final Project:  
There will be a final project. You will be asked to form groups of maximum 4. The project must explore a methodology or application not covered in the lectures. You will be asked to select a paper on a methodology not covered in class, and implement the method. You will grade each others projects using Canvas's peer grading feature.

Gradescope Entry Code:  

MG2XEE, use this code to add the course to your account.

Piazza:  
Most questions you have about the course, both logistical and technical, should be posted to Piazza. Questions about how to solve homework problems are encouraged, but responses should provide hints as opposed to detailed answers. You may indicate that your questions is for instructors only your question is of a sensitive nature or may disclose solutions to the class. 

Standards of Conduct  
Arrive to class on time. If you must enter a class after lecture has clearly begun, please do so quietly.  
Focus on class material during class time. Sleeping, doing work for another class, checking email, and exploring the internet are unacceptable and can be disruptive.  
Only use personal electronic devices during class for viewing or taking notes. If you elect to use a laptop during class, please type very quietly. Few things are more annoying than sitting next to someone who is pounding on their keyboard during a lecture.  
Refrain from eating during class.  
Avoid audible and visible signs of restlessness. These are both rude and disruptive to the rest of the class.  
Don't pack your bags to leave until the instructor has dismissed class. Thank you.  
Collaboration on homeworks:  
Each student will prepare the final write-up/coding of his or her homework solutions without reference to any other person or source, aside from the student's own notes or scrap work. Students may consult classmates for the purpose of brainstorming, but not for obtaining the details of solutions. Under no circumstances may you copy solutions or code from a classmate or other source.

Academic Integrity  
All undergraduate and graduate students are expected to abide by the College of Engineering Honor Code as stated in the [Student Handbook ](http://advising.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2015/06/2015fysh-final-v3-10.pdf) and the [Honor Code Pamphlet ](http://ossa.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/04/Honor-code-pamphlet-Adobe-Prof.pdf).

Students with Disabilities  
Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with me during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential.

Student Mental Health and Wellbeing  
The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. For help, contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (734) 764-8312 and https://caps.umich.edu/. during and after hours, on weekends and holidays, or through its counselors physically located in schools on both North and Central Campus. You may also consult University Health Service (UHS) at (734) 764-8320 and https://www.uhs.umich.edu/mentalhealthsvcs, or for alcohol or drug concerns, see https://www.uhs.umich.edu/aodresources. For a listing of other mental health resources available on and off campus, visit: http://umich.edu/~mhealth.

Equal opportunity
